# Blockchain Resources
Resources to learn and develop blockchain applications for everyone.

I have created this repository as there are not many resources on Blockchain. This repository has been created for those who are curious about this technology and wants to deep dive into it. **Everyone's invited to add more resources by create pull requests.**
I will be adding links to articles, books, YouTube videos and GitHub repos for deep theoretical as well as hands-on knowledge.

### Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of data structures.
- Understanding about any object-oriented language - C++, Java, JavaScript etc.
- Starring :star2: this repo! 

## What is Blockchain?
First of all, it's not Bitcoin! Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is just an application of blockchain technology.
> In simple words, blockchain is a chain or series of block of immutable data in a time-stamped chronological order.

It's almost tamper-proof due to very strong cryptographic functions. It's completely decentralized i.e. no central authority controls it. It's managed by all the members of the network. This tech is rapidly being adopted by banking sector, government authorities as well as enterprises.
